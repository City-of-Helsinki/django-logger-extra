    This filter merges user-provided extras with the active logger context variables.

    Values are written directly into the LogRecord's __dict__, the same place native
    extra fields are stored. This ensures that all formatters can access these context
    fields seamlessly, treating them just like native `extra` fields.

    For example, the following snippet stores both `greet` and `who` in the LogRecord:

    ```python
    with logger_context({"greet": "Hello"}) as ctx:
        logger.info("Lorem Ipsum...", extra={"who": "World"})
    ```
